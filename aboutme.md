# AboutMe

I'm *18* years old and currently majoring in I.T. at **Mizzou**. 

I really like all my classes so far. I love technology and programming, but I might minor in business too. My favorite class is my python class. Here is some code I wrote for it:

    print("Noah Mitchell")
    print("I am 18 years old")
    print("I'm a freshman at Mizzou")
    print("I have 1 brother, and 2 cats")
